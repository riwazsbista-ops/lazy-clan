        <h1 ><b>About lazy clan </b></h1>
        <p>Hello everyone. Lazy Clan is one of the best clans in ML. The name “Lazy” was given by the first-generation leader of Lazy Clan, Fisson, also known as Mewo Ali. The name “Lazy” is said to have originated in the mid-16th century, possibly related to the Low German word *lasich*, meaning “languid” or “idle.”

The second leader of Lazy was Rebu. During his leadership, he made Lazy a comfortable and reliable place for many ML players. After Rebu, Kitty became the leader of ML. Now Fission is once again the leader of Lazy, but the clan has started to decline.
